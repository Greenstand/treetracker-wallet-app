> **Secure and user-friendly digital token management platform built by
> Greenstand**

Greenstand offers a secure, user-friendly wallet for seamless token transfers,
built with enterprise-grade security and a scalable monorepo architecture
supporting web, mobile, and backend services.

_Treetracker Wallet App is part of the Greenstand ecosystem, enabling
transparent and verifiable tree planting and forest management through
blockchain technology._

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v20 or higher)
- **Yarn** (v1.22 or higher)
- **Docker** (for backend development)

### 🚀 One-Command Setup

```bash
# Clone, and install dependencies, and start development
git clone https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-wallet-app.git
cd treetracker-wallet-app && yarn install
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Start Development

#### Option 1: Quick Web Development

```bash
yarn web:dev
# Opens http://localhost:3000
```

#### Option 2: Full Stack Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend API
yarn user:dev

# Terminal 2: Start web application
yarn web:dev

# Terminal 3: Start mobile app
yarn native:start
```

### 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run E2E tests (recommended for understanding the project)
yarn cypress-e2e-test

# Or run headless tests
yarn cypress-e2e-headless-test
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Run the E2E tests to understand what this project does and how the
> apps work together!

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

### 🚀 Overview

Added comprehensive end-to-end testing using **WebdriverIO** for the wallet
application, covering:

- ✅ **Login flow** (success & failure cases)
- ✅ **Wallet creation** process
- ✅ **User registration** workflow
- ✅ **HTML test reports** with detailed execution analysis
- ✅ **Video recordings** for debugging failed tests
- and more

---

### 🧪 Test Commands

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
yarn bdd:e2e

# Run specific test suite
yarn bdd:e2e:login
yarn bdd:e2e:register
yarn bdd:e2e:wallet

# Debug mode (verbose output)
yarn bdd:e2e:debug

# Update ChromeDriver (if tests fail)
yarn bdd:e2e:update-driver

# Generate HTML test reports
yarn bdd:report          # Generate HTML report from existing test results
yarn bdd:test:report     # Run tests + generate HTML report
```

---

### 🖼️ Test Evidence

Sample Output:

![Sample Output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/456c64cf-b92f-4030-bf96-7b56bfdaa800)

```bash
$ yarn test:e2e
[chrome] ✔ Login - Valid credentials (4.2s)
[chrome] ✔ Wallet Creation - Basic flow (6.1s)
[chrome] ✔ Registration - Email signup (5.8s)
```

**HTML Test Reports:**

- Detailed execution analysis with pass/fail status
- Video recordings for debugging failed tests
- Browser metadata and execution timing
- Generated in `apps/bdd/reports/cucumber-html/index.html`

---

### ✅ Verification Checklist

- All tests pass locally (`yarn test:e2e`)
- HTML reports generated successfully (`yarn bdd:report`)
- Video recordings captured for failed tests
- No production code modified
- Test data follows PII guidelines
- ChromeDriver version (v136) matches CI
- Documentation updated if needed

---

### ⚠️ Requirements

The backend must be running for the tests to function. You can start it with:

```bash
yarn workspace web dev
```

Also, ensure you have Chrome v136+ installed.

## 🚀 Development Guide

Ready to contribute? Here's your path from setup to deployment:

1. **Fork the repository on GitHub**

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/treetracker-wallet-app.git
cd treetracker-wallet-app
yarn install
```

### 2. Choose Your Development Path

#### 🌐 **Web Development**

Perfect for UI/UX improvements and frontend features

```bash
yarn web:dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

#### 📱 **Mobile Development**

For cross-platform mobile features

```bash
yarn native:start
# → Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

#### 🔧 **Backend Development**

For API development and database work

```bash
# Setup environment (first time only)
cp apps/user/.env.example apps/user/.dev.env
# → Edit .dev.env with your configuration

yarn user:dev
# → http://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Full Stack Development

Run all services for integrated development:

```bash
# Individual terminals
yarn web:dev     # Terminal 1
yarn user:dev    # Terminal 2
yarn native:start # Terminal 3
```

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### Quick Testing

```bash
# E2E tests (best way to understand the project)
yarn cypress-e2e-test

# Headless testing
yarn cypress-e2e-headless-test

# Unit tests
yarn test

# Lint and format
yarn lint:fix

## Commit hooks and test behavior

We run `lint-staged` on commit to keep commits fast. Heavy integration/unit/e2e
tests are expensive and not run by default.

- Fast commit (default): `git commit -m "..."` — runs only `lint-staged`.
- Opt-in full tests during commit:
  `SKIP_HUSKY_TESTS=false git commit -m "..."`

Note: this repository uses Yarn v4 via Corepack. If you see a message about
Yarn versions, run:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@4.9.4 --activate
yarn -v  # should show a Yarn 4.x version
```

```

## How to set up: lint, code format, Typescript for a new package/app

Follow this PR too add shared configuration package to standardize linting,
formatting, and TypeScript setup across the project.
